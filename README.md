# Developer & Tech Support

## [Dmitrii Ivanov :suspect:](https://ivanovdk-bc.netlify.app/)

Hello! My name is **Dmitrii**. I'm 33 years old and currently based in Moscow, Russia.

I work as a **Technical Support Specialist** and **JavaScript/TypeScript developer**, with a broad background in IT, system administration, DevOps, and internal development. My passion lies in creating and improving interfaces of all kinds — from embedded web menus on microcontrollers to full‑scale web applications.

I build **desktop apps with Electron, mobile apps with Expo/React Native**, and explore diverse front‑end ecosystems including **React, Vue, htmx, and Next.js**. On the documentation side, I have extensive experience with **Vitepress, Fumadocs, Docusaurus, Docsify, markdown‑it**, and more. I also maintain and update company websites on WordPress.

For backend development, I use **Node.js, Deno, and Bun**, designing APIs and services to support my applications. My work combines hands‑on technical support with modern full‑stack development, giving me a versatile perspective across infrastructure, user experience, and software engineering.
